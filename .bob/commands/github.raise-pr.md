## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Use any provided input first. If key fields are missing, infer safely from available artifacts and report assumptions. Run in "Advanced" mode.

## Purpose

Finalize validated repo changes by creating required commits and then creating or reusing pull requests in a repeatable, governed way.

## Guardrails

- Never create a PR before validation has completed and the user has approved proceeding.
- Never create duplicate PRs for the same repo/branch pair.
- Never create PRs against non-GitHub remotes. Allowed hosts: github.com and github.ibm.com only.
- Never switch branches in the orchestrator repo.
- Never merge PRs; creation only.
- Do not use shell tools in this workflow.
- Use MCP filesystem tools for all file operations and MCP git tools for all git operations.

## Required Inputs Per Repo

- Story ID (for example: SAP-1234) — parent story key, used for the orchestrator repo branch and PR traceability
- Per-repo branch name — for sibling repos, this is the **child story key** (e.g., `SCRUM-11`) from `workflow-state.md > Child Stories`; for the orchestrator repo, this is the parent story key
- Repo path
- Story title
- Validation summary (unit tests, compile/lint outcomes)
- Target base branch (default: main)

## Workflow

1. Collect target repos from user input. If not provided, infer from `specs/<STORY_ID>/tasks.md` and include only repos with code changes in this run.
2. For each repo, run these checks in order:
   - Confirm the path is a git repository.
   - Determine the expected branch name for this repo: use the child story key (from the caller-provided per-repo branch mapping) for sibling repos; use the parent story ID for the orchestrator repo.
   - Confirm current branch is exactly the expected branch name for this repo.
   - Confirm `origin` remote URL host is explicitly allowlisted: `github.com` or `github.ibm.com` only (default-deny all other hosts).
   - Confirm validation summary is provided or inferable from workspace artifacts; if missing, mark `BLOCKED`.
   - Confirm GitHub MCP tools are available for PR operations.
3. For each repo, finalize post-validation git state:
   - Inspect working tree status (staged, unstaged, untracked).
   - If uncommitted changes exist, stage changes for that repo only.
   - Create at least one non-empty commit when changes are present.
   - Commit message format: `<STORY_ID>: <story title>` (or equivalent repo-specific scope).
   - Do not amend commits unless explicitly requested.
   - Ensure working tree is clean (`git status --porcelain` empty) before PR operations.
4. Push branch if needed using MCP git tooling:
   - Push the repo's expected branch (child story key for sibling repos; parent story ID for orchestrator repo) to `origin` and set upstream tracking when missing.
5. Detect existing PR before creating a new one:
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to list open PRs by head `<expected-branch-name>` (child story key or parent story ID as appropriate) and base `<base>`.
   - If one exists, reuse it and report `ALREADY_EXISTS`.
6. Create PR when no open PR exists:
   - Title format: `<CHILD_STORY_KEY>: <story title>` for sibling repos; `<STORY_ID>: <story title>` for the orchestrator repo
   - Body includes:
     - Summary of implemented changes (repo specific)
     - Validation evidence: unit tests and compile/lint status
     - Story traceability: reference to parent story `<STORY_ID>`, child story key (for sibling repos), and `specs/<STORY_ID>/` artifacts used
     - Commit evidence: commit hash and commit message created in this phase when applicable
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to create the PR.
7. Return a concise per-repo report with:
   - Repo
   - Branch
   - Base branch
   - Commit result (`CREATED`, `SKIPPED_NO_CHANGES`, or `BLOCKED`)
   - PR result (`CREATED`, `ALREADY_EXISTS`, or `BLOCKED`)
   - PR URL (if available)
   - Any blockers and remediation steps

## PR Review State Handling

After a PR is created or found to already exist, check its current review state using GitHub MCP tools before returning the final report.

### `CHANGES_REQUESTED` (rejection)

If any reviewer has submitted a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review on the PR:

1. Fetch all review comments from the PR using GitHub MCP tools.
2. Surface each comment in the output: reviewer login, file path (if applicable), line (if applicable), and comment body.
3. **Ask the user**: "The PR has reviewer comments requiring changes. Would you like me to apply the changes suggested in these comments? (yes / no / apply-specific: <comment numbers>)"
   - Wait for the user's explicit response before proceeding.
   - If **yes**: attempt to apply all suggested changes to the affected files in the working branch, commit with message `<STORY_ID>: address review comments`, push to origin, and re-evaluate the PR review state.
   - If **apply-specific**: apply only the comments identified by the user-supplied numbers, commit, push, and re-evaluate.
   - If **no**: skip auto-apply, mark the PR result as `BLOCKED — CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and return remediation steps (see below) so the user can act manually.
4. Do NOT proceed with any further phases (e.g., do not invoke `pdlc.pr-approval-gate`) for this repo until the review state is resolved.
5. If the user declined auto-apply, return remediation steps:
   - Address each reviewer comment in the working branch.
   - Push the updated commits to the same branch.
   - Re-run this agent to re-evaluate the PR state.

### `APPROVED`

If at least one approval exists and no `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review is outstanding, continue normally.

### `REVIEW_REQUIRED` / no reviews yet

If the PR is open but has no reviews, report `PENDING_REVIEW` and surface the PR URL so the caller can share it with approvers. Do not block; allow the caller to decide whether to wait.

## Failure Handling

If any repo fails pre-checks, commit finalization, push checks, or has an active `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review, do not proceed with PR approval gate invocation for that repo. Continue evaluating remaining repos and report all blockers clearly at the end.
