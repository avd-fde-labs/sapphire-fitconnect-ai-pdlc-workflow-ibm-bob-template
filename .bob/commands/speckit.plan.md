## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). Run in "Advanced" mode.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before planning)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_plan` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

---

## PDLC Orchestration — Pre-Plan

> **Activation**: This section executes only when `$ARGUMENTS` contains a `STORY_ID=<value>` token. If no `STORY_ID` is present, skip this section and proceed directly to the Outline.

### Settings Load

Read `settings.yaml` from the workspace root and resolve the same session variables as in `speckit.specify` (submitter_role, spec_approver_role with require_merge, plan_approver_role, tasks_approver_role, and their GitHub team/users). Use defaults if any key is absent.

### Phase 3C: Plan Entry Gates (mandatory)

Before proceeding to planning, verify that the spec approval gate is satisfied. Rather than invoking an external gate command, perform the check directly:

> **Test bypass**: If `SKIP_APPROVAL_GATES=true` is in `$ARGUMENTS`, skip all gate checks below, log `TEST_BYPASS active: Phase 3C spec gate skipped`, and proceed to Skill Auto-Detection.

1. Verify Phase 3A is complete: a spec PR exists for branch `<STORY_ID>`. Check `Key Data > Spec PR` in `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`.
   - If absent, block: "No spec PR found. Run `/speckit.specify STORY_ID=<STORY_ID>` or `/speckit.clarify STORY_ID=<STORY_ID>` to raise the spec PR first."

2. Read `settings.yaml` and resolve:
   - `spec_approver_role` = `pdlc.approvals.spec.approver_role` (default: `product_owner`)
   - `spec_require_merge` = `pdlc.approvals.spec.require_merge` (default: `true`)
   - GitHub team/users = `pdlc.roles.<spec_approver_role>.github_team` / `.github_users`

3. Use GitHub MCP tools to find the spec PR from head `<STORY_ID>` to `main` (look at both open and merged PRs).

4. Fetch all reviews on the PR:
   - If any reviewer submitted `CHANGES_REQUESTED`: surface each reviewer login and comment. Block with: "Spec PR has changes requested. Resolve the reviewer's feedback via `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.specify`, then re-run `/speckit.plan`."
   - Otherwise verify: at least one approval from the resolved `spec_approver_role` team/users exists.
   - If `spec_require_merge: true`, verify PR state is `MERGED`.

5. If gate conditions are not met: display current PR review status and block. Do not proceed to planning until gate passes.

**State Update — Phase 3C Entry Gates passed:**
In `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`, mark `[x] Phase 3C: Plan Entry Gates` and set `CURRENT_STAGE` to `PHASE_4_PENDING`.

### Skill Auto-Detection

Before proceeding to the Outline, scan `$ARGUMENTS` and any existing `specs/<STORY_ID>/spec.md` to detect the tech stack and load all relevant skills using `read_file`.

Print an evidence block:

```text
## Skills Loaded

- Detected technologies: <comma-separated list or "none">
- Skills loaded:
  - <path 1>
```

**Load the parent skill router** for each detected technology (skills located at `../skills` relative to this commands folder):

| Detected technology | Parent skill router to load |
|---|---|
| Java, Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle | `../skills/java/SKILL.md` |
| GraphQL schema, SDL, resolvers | `../skills/graphql/SKILL.md` |
| React, JSX, hooks, components | `../skills/react/SKILL.md` |

Apply all loaded skill guidance throughout the plan. If no technology match is found, skip.

---

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/setup-plan.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**:

   a. Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/runtime/effective-constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied). If the runtime effective constitution file is missing, stop and instruct the user to run `/constitution.resolve` first.

   b. **Load platform and codebase context** — read `AGENTS.md` from the workspace root. Extract the full repo registry (name, description, tech stack, conventions). Based on FEATURE_SPEC content (user stories, described functionality, referenced entities), identify the affected repos.

   c. For each affected repo, explore the sibling repository at `../` relative to the workspace root to understand existing code before designing:
      - **Java/Spring Boot**: read existing controller, service, repository, and entity/DTO files. Note current method signatures, endpoint paths, field names, and patterns that must be extended rather than replaced.
      - **Python/FastAPI**: read existing route modules, Pydantic model files, and `main.py`/`app.py`. Note existing endpoint paths, model field names, and dependency injection patterns.
      - **TypeScript/React**: read existing feature component directories, hooks, and relevant Apollo queries/mutations. Note current cache policies, component prop shapes, and state patterns.
      - **All repos**: read `README.md` if present.
      - Do NOT read build outputs (`target/`, `dist/`, `.next/`), `node_modules/`, or generated files.

   d. Output a **Codebase Snapshot** block:
      ```
      ## Codebase Snapshot
      Affected repos: <list>
      Key existing code observed:
      - <repo>: <existing endpoints/methods, entity names, notable patterns>
      ...
      ```
      Reference this snapshot throughout plan generation to ensure technical decisions build on existing patterns, correct file paths and class names are used, and new fields/endpoints follow established naming conventions.

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

5. **Check for extension hooks**: After reporting, check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
   - If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_plan` key
   - If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
   - Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
   - For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
     - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
     - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
   - For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
     - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Optional Hook**: {extension}
       Command: `/{command}`
       Description: {description}

       Prompt: {prompt}
       To execute: `/{command}`
       ```
     - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
       ```
       ## Extension Hooks

       **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
       Executing: `/{command}`
       EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
       ```
   - If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Define interface contracts** (if project has external interfaces) → `/contracts/`:
   - Identify what interfaces the project exposes to users or other systems
   - Document the contract format appropriate for the project type
   - Examples: public APIs for libraries, command schemas for CLI tools, endpoints for web services, grammars for parsers, UI contracts for applications
   - Skip if project is purely internal (build scripts, one-off tools, etc.)

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType bob`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## PDLC Orchestration — Post-Plan

> **Activation**: This section executes only when `$ARGUMENTS` contained a `STORY_ID=<value>` token and the PDLC Pre-Plan section ran above.

After the plan artifacts have been generated (Outline complete), execute these PDLC governance steps.

> **Note on the `after_plan` extension hook**: The `after_plan` hook in `.specify/extensions.yml` calls `pdlc.pr-approval-gate ARTIFACT=plan` as an optional reminder. The full Phase 4B flow below (commit → raise PR → wait for approval) is the authoritative gate. Proceed through the steps below.

**State Update — Phase 4 complete:**
In `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`, set `CURRENT_STAGE` to `CHECKPOINT_2A_PENDING` and mark `[x] Phase 4: Plan`.

### CHECKPOINT 2A — Submitter Plan Review Before PR Submission

Present:
- A structured summary of `specs/<STORY_ID>/plan.md`: key architecture decisions, technical context summary, data model overview, and affected repos.
- List of all additional plan artifacts produced (`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`).
- Resolved `submitter_role` and `plan_approver_role` with its GitHub team/users.

Ask the user:
> "`<submitter_role>` checkpoint: please review the plan. Does everything look correct?
> Type **yes** to commit and raise the design PR, or describe the corrections needed."

**Correction loop** — repeat until submitter approves:
1. If the user requests corrections, apply them to the relevant plan artifacts as instructed.
2. After applying corrections, present a brief summary of what changed.
3. Ask: "Are there any more corrections needed, or does the plan look good to proceed?"
4. If more corrections requested, return to step 1. When user confirms (types **yes** or equivalent), exit the loop.

Do not commit, push, or raise any PR until the submitter has explicitly confirmed.

**State Update — CHECKPOINT 2A approved:**
In `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`, set `CURRENT_STAGE` to `PHASE_4B_PENDING` and mark `[x] CHECKPOINT 2A: Submitter Plan Review`.

### Phase 4B — Plan Approval Gate

**Test bypass**: If `SKIP_APPROVAL_GATES=true` is in `$ARGUMENTS`, still commit and push plan artifacts and create/reuse the design PR, then skip reviewer wait. Present warning: `TEST_BYPASS active: Phase 4B approval gate skipped`. Set `Key Data > Plan Approval` to `TEST_BYPASS` and continue to Phase 5.

1. Commit plan artifacts to the `<STORY_ID>` branch:
   - Stage all new or modified files under `specs/<STORY_ID>/` produced by the plan phase (`plan.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`).
   - Hard rule: only stage files within `specs/<STORY_ID>/`. Do not stage files outside `specs/`.
   - Commit message: `<STORY_ID>: add plan artifacts for review`
   - Push to `origin/<STORY_ID>`.

2. Identify or raise the design review PR:
   - Use GitHub MCP tools to check for an open PR from head `<STORY_ID>` to `main`.
   - If none exists, raise one with title: `<STORY_ID>: <story title> — design artifacts`
   - If one exists, reuse it. Record the PR URL under `Key Data > Plan PR` in `workflow-state.md`.

**State Update — Plan PR Raised:**
In `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`, mark `[x] Phase 4A: Plan PR Raised`.

3. Request review from the resolved `plan_approver_role` team/users on the PR.

4. Present to the user:
   > "Plan artifacts have been committed and pushed. Awaiting `<plan_approver_role>` approval on the design PR: `<PR_URL>`
   > Type **yes** once the plan has been approved, or describe any issues."

5. On user confirmation, verify via GitHub MCP:
   - Fetch all reviews on the PR. If any reviewer submitted `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, surface each comment and block — prompt: "The PR has reviewer changes requested. Would you like me to apply the suggested changes? (yes / no / apply-specific: <comment numbers>)"
   - Otherwise verify: at least one approval from `plan_approver_role` team/users exists.
   - If `plan_require_merge: true`, verify the PR is also merged.
   - If not met: display current PR review status and prompt again. Do not accept chat-only confirmation as a bypass.

**Hard stop**: Do not proceed to Phase 5 until the plan PR has the required approval from `<plan_approver_role>`, unless `SKIP_APPROVAL_GATES=true`.

**State Update — Phase 4B complete:**
In `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`, set `CURRENT_STAGE` to `PHASE_5_PENDING`, mark `[x] Phase 4B: Plan Approved`, and record the plan approver identity and approval timestamp (or `TEST_BYPASS`) under `Key Data > Plan Approval`.

### Phase 5 — Create Child Jira Stories

Run immediately after Phase 4B. Creates one Jira child story per affected repo and links each to the parent story.

> **Formatting rule**: When calling any Jira MCP tool, always pass body text with actual line breaks — never use `\n` escape sequences in string literals.

1. Read the `Affected Repos` list from `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`.

2. For each affected repo, create a Jira story using the Jira MCP tool:
   - **Summary**: `[<REPO>] <parent story title>`
   - **Description** (substitute all placeholders, use real newline characters):

     ```
     Child story for parent: <STORY_ID> — <parent story title>

     Scope: Implementation work in the `<REPO>` repository.

     Spec artifacts:
     - Spec:  specs/<STORY_ID>/spec.md
     - Plan:  specs/<STORY_ID>/plan.md
     - Tasks: specs/<STORY_ID>/tasks.md
     ```

   - **Issue type**: Story (same project as the parent story)

3. Collect the newly created story key for each repo (e.g., `SCRUM-11`).

4. For each newly created child story, create an issue link to the parent story using `jira_create_issue_link`:
   - `inward_issue_key`: `<child-story-key>`
   - `outward_issue_key`: `<STORY_ID>`
   - `link_type`: `"Relates to"` (prefer `"is subtask of"` or `"Epic-Story Link"` if the project supports them)
   - If the link call fails, log `LINK_FAILED: <child-key> → <STORY_ID>: <reason>` and continue.

5. Record all child story keys in `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md` under `## Child Stories`:
   ```
   <repo-1>: <child-key-1>
   <repo-2>: <child-key-2>
   ```

6. Display a summary table:

   | Repo | Child Story Key | Parent Link |
   |------|----------------|-------------|
   | `<repo>` | `<key>` | `LINKED` / `LINK_FAILED` |

**State Update — Phase 5 complete:**
In `specs/<STORY_ID>/workflow-state.md`, set `CURRENT_STAGE` to `PHASE_6_PENDING` and mark `[x] Phase 5: Child Stories Created`.

> **Next step**: Run `/speckit.tasks STORY_ID=<STORY_ID>` to generate the dependency-ordered task list.
